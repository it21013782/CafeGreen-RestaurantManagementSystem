# CafeGreen - Cafeteria Management System

Café Green is a popular restaurant situated in the center of the Colombo district. The café is daily visited by many customers. They provide services such as dine-in, takeaway, and delivery of various food items. In this café, the management and staff manage all their processes such as employee management, supplier management, order management, financial accounts management, etc. manually. Hence, the entire productivity of the restaurant is inadequate and costly. In addition, the data of financial accounts and other important information is at risk of data loss. Therefore, we are planning to develop a web application for this cafeteria to do their essential tasks more conveniently and productively. Almost all their specific tasks will be automated by deploying this system. Thus, it will deduct the number of employees which in return, will reduce the cost of the salaries. Furthermore, the system will expand the customer experience, and attract new customers. In conclusion, both the management and customers will benefit from this system.

## Features

The web application includes the following eight core features:

- **Order Management**: Streamline the process of taking, managing, and fulfilling customer orders.
- **Employee Management**: Efficiently handle employee-related tasks, including scheduling, attendance, and performance tracking.
- **Planning and Progress Management**: Monitor and plan various aspects of the restaurant's operations for better efficiency.
- **Menu Management**: Easily update and manage the restaurant's menu, ensuring accuracy and responsiveness to customer preferences.
- **Stock Management**: Keep track of inventory, reducing waste and ensuring items are always in stock.
- **Supplier Management**: Manage relationships with suppliers, ensuring a smooth supply chain.
- **Financial Management**: Automate financial accounts management, reducing manual errors and the risk of data loss.
- **Customer Management**: Enhance customer experience by keeping track of preferences, feedback, and contact information.
