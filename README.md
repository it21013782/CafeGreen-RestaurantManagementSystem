# CafeGreen - Cafeteria Management System

Café Green Web Application is a successfully implemented solution for Café Green, a renowned restaurant in the heart of the Colombo district. Recognizing the daily influx of customers seeking dine-in, takeaway, and delivery services for a variety of culinary delights, the management decided to enhance operational efficiency. Prior to the implementation of this web application, the restaurant relied on manual processes for employee management, supplier interactions, order handling, and financial accounts management.

The previous manual approach not only hindered productivity but also posed a risk of data loss for crucial financial and operational information. In response, our team developed a comprehensive web application tailored to automate specific tasks critical to the restaurant's operations. By deploying this system, Café Green has significantly reduced the need for manual intervention in various processes, leading to a reduction in labor costs and an overall improvement in productivity.

## Features

The web application includes the following eight core features:

- **Order Management**: Streamline the process of taking, managing, and fulfilling customer orders.
- **Employee Management**: Efficiently handle employee-related tasks, including scheduling, attendance, and performance tracking.
- **Planning and Progress Management**: Monitor and plan various aspects of the restaurant's operations for better efficiency.
